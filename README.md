# PiHole Blacklist

My personal Blacklists.


Beside my Kreisklasse-blocklists,  
i use also the following blacklists on my pihole:

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EnergizedProtection/block/master/basic/formats/hosts  
update frequency: every friday

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/anudeepND/blacklist/master/facebook.txt  
update frequency: unknown

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imkarthikk/pihole-facebook/master/pihole-facebook.txt  
update frequency: acc. to file, daily

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/notracking/hosts-blocklists/master/hostnames.txt

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/notracking/hosts-blocklists/master/domains.txt

this gives me a number of blocked urls of about 480.000


i also tried this one,  
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deathbybandaid/piholeparser/master/Subscribable-Lists/CombinedBlacklists/CombinedBlackLists.txt  
update frequency: acc. to file, daily  
but it blocks about 2.5 Million urls. For me it blocks to much. But you can try it.
